# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "master" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "master", "r[0-9][0-9].[0-9][0-9]",  "r[0-9][0-9].[0-9]"]
  #pull_request:
  #  branches: [ "master" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      - name: Checkout codebase
        env:
          sample: ${{ join(github.event.commits.*.modified) }}
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Run a one-line script
        env:
          AWS: '{"sample":{"cluster_name":"sample","account_id":"12345"},"sample1":{"cluster_name":"sample1","account_id":"54321"}}'
        run: echo ${{ fromJson(env.AWS)[matrix.index].cluster_name }}
