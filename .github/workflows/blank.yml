# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "master" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "master" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "master" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - name: Set outputs
        id: aws-vars
        run: |
          echo "aws= { sample: { cluster_name: 'sample', account_id: '12345' }, sample1: { cluster_name: 'sample1', account_id: '54321' } }" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          echo "s=sample" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          echo "t=cluster_name" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Run a one-line script
        run: echo ${{ fromJson(steps.aws-vars.outputs.aws)[steps.aws-vars.outputs.s].cluster_name }}

      # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
      - name: Run a multi-line script
        run: |
          echo Add other actions to build,
          echo test, and deploy your project.
